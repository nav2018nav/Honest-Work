content = "Research and development of life-saving treatments can be a costly business, and so sometimes high drug prices are inevitable. However, it is frequently the case that prices are set with no reference to these costs but rather are set at the maximum the market will bear. Acquiring smaller companies and then increasing the prices of the drugs they sell is also not uncommon. Partially as a result, 34 million Americans have lost a family member or a friend in the last five years, not because the treatment didn't exist, but because they couldn't afford it.\n\nA subset of this issue is how healthcare companies interact with the patent system. Patents exist so that companies can enjoy exclusive rights to the profit of an invention for a limited period after its launch - in most cases 20 years. However, companies often file multiple patents (sometimes over 100 per drug) and make minor adjustments to their product to extend the life of the patent, resulting in prices that are unaffordable for many over an ever longer period of time."

answer = "* Has your company significantly increased the price of life-saving or necessary drugs over the past five years?\n* Does your company publish the formulae or criteria which determine how its drugs are priced?\n* Does your company use equitable pricing to enable access to its drugs in less wealthy countries?\n* Has your company engaged in ‘evergreening’, extending the patent life of its drugs?\n* Does your organisation (and the trade groups which it is a member of) support the five [R.A.I.S.E.](https://www.i-mak.org/mission/) priorities for reform of the patent system?"

answer = "_What you need to know_ - Different countries around the world have particular needs for certain drugs and differing abilities to afford them; this is why [equitable pricing](https://accesstomedicinefoundation.org/access-to-medicine-index/2018-ranking/subranking/pricing) strategies for drugs is crucial. Yet even in the US -which, as a wealthy country, should be expected to pay higher drug prices than other countries - pays a multiple of the price in comparable countries. Americans spent $535 billion on prescription drugs in 2018, an [increase](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2019/08/30/473911/big-pharma-reaps-profits-hurting-everyday-americans/) of 50% since 2010. The price of long-established drugs such as [insulin](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/opinion/cost-insurance-diabetes-insulin.html) has risen at a rate far greater than inflation, while the amount spent on [medical marketing](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2720029) has also increased substantially.\n\n_The most urgent issue -_ The patent system has been abused by companies for a long time; reform is desperately needed both legally and in companies’ practices. Priti Krishtel of I-MAK gives a TED talk on the topic [here](https://www.ted.com/talks/priti_krishtel_why_are_drug_prices_so_high_investigating_the_outdated_us_patent_system); for a deeper dive, check out this [report](https://www.i-mak.org/overpatented-overpriced-excessive-pharmaceutical-patenting-extending-monopolies-driving-drug-prices/)."

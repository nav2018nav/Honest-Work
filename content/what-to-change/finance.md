content = "Finance powers the entire economy; banks, through their lending, and investors, through their holdings, have major influence over how companies act and what projects get financed. Choose any issue from any of these pages; financial sector companies can help fix it, if they choose.\n\nMost of these companies see addressing societal issues as someone else’s responsibility. Banks say it is not their job to dictate outcomes. Passive investors, stock exchanges, index providers and other financial services companies believe their role is to replicate the market and reflect the investable universe rather than enabling money to flow towards companies that contribute to the general good (and tend to lobby against regulatory measures that would encourage this). When it’s no one’s job to prevent negative outcomes, negative outcomes is what you get."

content = "Shareholders exercise greater control over companies than at any other time in history. Yet they have failed to prevent, and have even encouraged, the misdeeds and abuses perpetrated by their investee companies, be it climate change, inequality and the precarisation of work, or human rights abuses. This is despite the fact that most of the money that they manage comes from the pensions of everyday workers, who have an interest not just in a stable retirement income but also in the world in which they live and retire.\n\nThere is increasing recognition of the role of investors in fixing problems generated by portfolio companies; as seen with the explosion in popularity of ESG (environmental, social and governance) investing. But beyond nice marketing too few investors back substantive change, and continue to support companies in plundering public goods as long as it remains profitable to do so.\n\nInvestors have two major ways to influence outcomes for society - how they select the companies they are willing to invest in, and the expectations they set of those companies. For the former, this means ensuring money is directed towards companies and projects that contribute to the collective good, and withheld where it would cause harm. For the latter, this means demanding companies align their activities with the interests of society, and voting against management where they do not."

answer = "What you need to know - The Financial Times’ [Moral Money](https://www.ft.com/moral-money) newsletter is a good resource for the latest updates on sustainable investing. For shareholder voting, [Majority Action](https://www.majorityaction.us/) sets out the key issues to look out for and how the largest asset managers vote on relevant shareholder proposals.\n\nWhat you can ask for - There are a number of relevant initiatives investors in this space can join. For asset owners, the [Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance](https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-alliance/) have pledged to decarbonise their portfolios by 2050. [ClimateAction100+](http://www.climateaction100.org/) is a collection of hundreds of investors engaging the world’s most polluting companies to change their practices. Investors can also support needed policy change such as the [EU taxonomy](https://d8g8t13e9vf2o.cloudfront.net/Uploads/d/s/r/taxonomyinvestorbriefingpostdeal_612580.pdf), which requires investors to disclose the sustainability of their portfolios."

content = "Many projects can’t take place without bank financing. Many fossil fuel exploration projects in particular depend on bank financing, and thus banks have a much more direct and contributing role to fossil fuel projects than other actors.\n\n35 global banks have granted $2.7 trillion in financing to fossil fuel companies since the Paris Agreement, which seeks to limit global warming. Few banks assess whether they are causing or contributing to human rights breaches. If banks were less indifferent to how their money was used, companies and projects that threatened to harm the public good would struggle to get off the ground."

answer = "_What you need to know -_ RAN [tracks](https://www.ran.org/bankingonclimatechange2020/) bank finance for fossil fuel over time. [Greenpeace](https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/28243/greenpeace-report-davos-financial-players-pump-us1-4-trillion-into-fossil-fuels/) has shown how many of the world’s biggest banks continue to funnel money into fossil fuels despite public statements that they will help combat climate change. BankTrack has also produced [research](https://www.banktrack.org/campaign/banks_and_human_rights) on the role of banks in relation to human rights.\n\n_The most urgent issue -_ If the world was to only burn all known fossil fuel reserves, that would already take the planet beyond 2 degrees of global warming, well beyond the [1.5 degrees](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/) limit needed to avoid some catastrophic consequences. Despite this, fossil fuel expansion continues. Banks should not finance the expansion of fossil fuel extraction or infrastructure, whether via project finance (direct financing for a fossil fuel asset) or general corporate support (financing provided to a company overall), for companies expanding fossil fuels."
